Automates updates to OpenSSL Makefiles.

Each automated change is incremental and idempotent; running the script more
than once will not produce any changes after the first run.

The changes generated by this script are part of the OpenSSL build system
refactoring described in:

  http://mike-bland.com/2014/06/26/makefile-refactoring.html

The changes are posted in the 'makefiles' branch of the mbland/openssl fork:
